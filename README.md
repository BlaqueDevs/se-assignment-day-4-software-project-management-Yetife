Requires Close Collaboration: Success depends on constant communication and active stakeholder involvement.

Documentation May Be Lacking: Agile prioritizes working software over detailed documentation, which can cause challenges for future maintenance.


Waterfall Methodology

Waterfall is a linear and structured approach where the project progresses sequentially through predefined phases: requirement gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

Advantages of Waterfall

Clear Structure: Well-defined stages make it easy to track progress and estimate costs.

Thorough Documentation: Comprehensive documentation supports long-term maintenance.

Easier Management: Works well for projects with fixed requirements and predictable outcomes.


Disadvantages of Waterfall
